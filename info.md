Stating the problem: 
Japan’s experience with natural disasters has produced one of the world’s most advanced systems of structural mitigation and preparedness. However, research consistently shows that while Japan is extremely good at engineering resilience, it puts less emphasis on post-disaster mental support and psychosocial recovery, which are equally critical for long-term resilience (Aldrich, 2015). 

So based on research, we identified a gap between Japan’s internationally recognized strengths, such as coastal defenses, evacuation systems, school-based drills, and reconstruction planning, and global best practices in mental-health interventions after disasters. In other words, physical reconstruction alone is insufficient; sustainable recovery depends on the social and psychological health of communities.

Countries such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Haiti, and the Philippines have developed strong community-based psychosocial programmes, including locally trained counsellors, Psychological First Aid training, and integration of mental-health into primary care, approaches that complement Japan’s engineering strengths and offer concrete expertise for exchange (de Jong et al., 2005; Wickrama et al., 2011; Sherchan et al./WHO, 2017; Raviola et al., 2012; Landoy et al., 2015)


Proposal: 
Based on this, our proposed solution is a Global Resilience Hub in Kamaishi: a space where Japan shares its evidence-based approaches to structural resilience, community drills, and reconstruction planning, while partner countries bring their strengths in psychosocial recovery, trauma-informed care, and community-based mental-health support. This idea is grounded in existing practice. Kamaishi already participates in bilateral collaboration with Indonesia. They have an exchange program between Banda Aceh and Kamaishi with a focus on post-tsunami recovery interaction (JICA, 2024). We propose scaling this into a structured, research-driven, multi-country hub.

Our model is supported by research. Firstly, research on disaster recoverylike Aldrich, shows that communities recover faster when people are connected, trust each other, and participate in local activities. In other words, strong social networks directly support resilience (Aldrich, 2015).
Secondly, studies on digital mental-health tools find that tele-counseling, online peer-support groups, and digital screening systems make it much easier for people to receive psychological help after disasters. This is especially important when local mental-health resources are limited or overstretched (Smith & Jones, 2021).
Thirdly, the Sendai Framework, which is the global guideline for disaster risk reduction, emphasizes the importance of international cooperation, shared learning, and using measurable indicators that look beyond physical rebuilding (UNDRR, 2015).

Building on this research, we propose the hub as a simple reinforcing cycle:
Knowledge exchange:
Experts, students, and community leaders from different countries come to Kamaishi to learn about Japan’s disaster education, evacuation systems, and long-term reconstruction planning.

Program design:
These visitors then work with local partners to co-create practical programs, such as school disaster drills, preparedness workshops, or culturally appropriate mental-health activities.

Community bonding and psychosocial support:
Running these programs together strengthens relationships and emotional safety within communities. Studies show that trust and social connection improve how people understand risk and how they behave during emergencies (Aldrich, 2015).

Outcomes:
As a result, communities gain clearer evacuation knowledge, better preparedness skills, and easier access to mental-health support.

Scaling:
Finally, these outcomes create data, case studies, and toolkits. This evidence attracts new partners and funding, bringing more countries into the hub and continuing the cycle of improvement.

Program itself:
Turning this concept into an actionable program requires a phased implementation strategy. 


First, starting with establishing a Steering Group (Kamaishi City, Iwate Prefecture, academic partners, international collaborators) to define governance, ethical standards, funding channels, and research protocols to coordinate activities, manage visiting delegations, and host workshops.

Then, launch core programs with short-term fellowships for educators, planners, and mental-health practitioners to work on a digital platform for disaster-education resources and mental-health. Additional community-based activities will be helpful to share and exchange experiences by visiting practitioners and local volunteers.


The Hub should incorporate a clear evaluation framework, such as 
Quantitative metrics: training participation, preparedness assessment scores, disaster drill performance, utilization of mental-health services, and usage statistics of the digital platform.
Qualitative metrics: interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation to capture changes in social trust, perceived support, and community cohesion — all dimensions shown in the literature to influence recovery trajectories (Aldrich, 2015; WHO, 2017).

Institutional structure must balance local ownership with international collaboration - write about collaboration between different departments, so people have a holistic overview. 

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, our proposal builds on Kamaishi’s existing international relationships but evolves them into a research-driven, scalable, and measurable model for global resilience exchange. By connecting Japan’s world-leading structural preparedness with international expertise in mental-health recovery — and grounding the entire system in evidence and evaluation — the Global Resilience Hub becomes not an abstract vision, but a realistic, actionable pathway for strengthening disaster resilience both in Japan and around the world.
Thank you for your attention. I welcome any questions regarding the design, research protocols, or partnership strategy.
